# Decision-making in conditions of full information. The task of packing into containers

## ðŸª„ To run the app:
* Make sure Node.js and npm are installed on your computer.
* From the command line in the './frontend' folder, run the command 'npm install' to install all necessary dependencies.
* After installing the dependencies, build the project by running 'npm run build'.
* After launching the Spring Boot application, open a browser and go to the address 'http://localhost:8080' (or another port on which Spring Boot works by default).
